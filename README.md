## Summary
The data indicate biases toward a five-star rating from paid Vine reviewers. The number of paid Vine reviews is low,107, compared to the non-paid views,39850. 56 paid Vine reviewers gave a specific outdoor product a five-star rating. The data suggests that 52% of the paid Vine members submitted a five-star rating.  For a deeper look into bias, recommendations are below:
1.	Analyzing data for the rest of the star ratings, one to four, and comparing the paid Vine reviewers to the non-paid reviewers.  
2.	Create a dataset based on reviews where paid Vine reviewers and non-paid reviewers comment on the same specific product. Vine members did not review many products.
